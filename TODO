* When the database says that a file exists, but the file is not found on disk,
  issue a warning and send a mail to pathdev, or log the warning and have a
  cron job that checks for new warnings periodically
* Keep a log of pathfind runs, with a record of the time each one takes
* Be careful trying to parallelise queries: pathfind is used from scripts
  running on the farm, so it's possible to saturate the number of DB
  connections
* Could replicate the current set of pathogen_*_track databases and clear
  out old data to make find queries quicker
